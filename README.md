**JS Week 4 Code Review - Independent Project**

***Overview***
For this week's code review, I'd really like to explore how I can use Javascript to become a better web designer. I feel like there are many different ways Javascript can be used, but I'd like to do some research across the web as to how designers are using Javascript on a day-to-day basis, and start focusing on honing my skills in that direction. For example, do designers use Javascript for visualizations? Or do they use it more for app-like features. What are the things that I'll need to know, and be really good at, to be a great front-end web developer.

***Plan***
I plan that my day will look like:

 - Research how designers use Javascript. I'll search use search terms such as: "Javascript for designers", "How do designers use Javascript?", etc. My goal is to get a better understanding of which frameworks designers use, what tools they find helpful, and what type of projects they use Javascript for.
 - Find good resources for learning, and dive into learning how to apply the skills that I already have.
 - Maybe, if time allows, start a project. Whether its a visualization or an app, I'm not sure. I'm hoping through research and learning, I'll have a bit of direction.

 ***Implementation***

 I did some reading up on blogs and reddit. I decided that the best way to go would just be to follow some tutorials that developers put out there to see how they use Javascript in their programs. I found this great website: [envatotuts+](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/categories/javascript). It has a bunch of tutorials

 The first tutorial I went through was a ["Simple Javascript Star Rating Tutorial"](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/a-simple-javascript-technique-for-filling-star-ratings--cms-29450)
 - Here is a link to my [CodePen] (https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/a-simple-javascript-technique-for-filling-star-ratings--cms-29450)

 The second tutorial I went through was a ["How to Create a Split-Screen Slider With JavaScript"](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-create-a-split-screen-slider-with-javascript--cms-28844). I really liked this tutorial, it was much less "hand-holdy", if thats a thing. I also converted the tutorial's normal Javascript to Jquery, which I'm more familiar with, as its what we learned in class. It may not seem like much, but being able to do it was a confidence booster. The end result was pretty OK - I used some minimal Illustrator skills to create two Christmas trees, but they don't match up perfectly, and I was spending way too much time on them, so I let it go. Also, maybe its just my internet, but the movement of the bar across the page is really jerky. I'm not sure whats going on there.
 - Here is a like to my [CodePen for this project](https://codepen.io/jbellwaite/pen/XVmNEm?editors=0110).

 Thirdly, I started going through the [How to Build a Shifting Underline Hover Effect With CSS and JavaScript](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-build-a-shifting-underline-hover-effect-with-css-and-javascript--cms-28510), but I didn't get very far by the time 5PM came around. I'll continue working on it.
 - For now, here is the link to my [CodePen](https://codepen.io/jbellwaite/pen/QajpRr?editors=0010).


 ***Conclusion***

 Overall, today I didn't work much on Angular, or APIs, or BDD... or much of anything we learned during this course, I do feel much more capable in my ability to apply what I do know in different situations. And, when I don't know, I know where in the documentation to look for answers.

 ****Of Note****

I took screenshots of articles that I read and some of the tutorials that I went through - they are in the 'screen-shots' folder.
