**JS Week 4 Code Review - Independent Project**

***Overview***
For this week's code review, I'd really like to explore how I can use Javascript to become a better web designer. I feel like there are many different ways Javascript can be used, but I'd like to do some research across the web as to how designers are using Javascript on a day-to-day basis, and start focusing on honing my skills in that direction. For example, do designers use Javascript for visualizations? Or do they use it more for app-like features. What are the things that I'll need to know, and be really good at, to be a great front-end web developer.

***Plan***
As of 8:30 AM, I plan that my day will look like:

 - Research how designers use Javascript. I'll search use search terms such as: "Javascript for designers", "Javascript for better design", etc. My goal is to get a better understanding of which frameworks designers use, what tools they find helpful, and what type of projects they use Javascript for.
 - Find good resources for learning, and dive into learning how to apply the skills that I already have.
 - Maybe, if time allows, start a project. Whether its a visualization or an app, I'm not sure. I'm hoping through research and learning, I'll have a bit of direction.
