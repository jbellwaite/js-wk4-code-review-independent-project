**JS Week 4 Code Review - Independent Project**

***Overview***
For this week's code review, I'd really like to explore how I can use Javascript to become a better web designer. I feel like there are many different ways Javascript can be used, but I'd like to do some research across the web as to how designers are using Javascript on a day-to-day basis, and start focusing on honing my skills in that direction. For example, do designers use Javascript for visualizations? Or do they use it more for app-like features. What are the things that I'll need to know, and be really good at, to be a great front-end web developer.

***Plan***
I plan that my day will look like:

 - Research how designers use Javascript. I'll search use search terms such as: "Javascript for designers", "How do designers use Javascript?", etc. My goal is to get a better understanding of which frameworks designers use, what tools they find helpful, and what type of projects they use Javascript for.
 - Find good resources for learning, and dive into learning how to apply the skills that I already have.
 - Maybe, if time allows, start a project. Whether its a visualization or an app, I'm not sure. I'm hoping through research and learning, I'll have a bit of direction.


 ***Implementation***

 I did some reading up on blogs and reddit. I decided that the best way to go would just be to follow some tutorials that developers put out there to see how they use Javascript in their programs. I found this great website: [envatotuts+](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/categories/javascript). It has a bunch of tutorials

 The first tutorial I went through was a ["Simple Javascript Star Rating Tutorial"](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/a-simple-javascript-technique-for-filling-star-ratings--cms-29450)
 - Here is a link to my [CodePen] (https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/a-simple-javascript-technique-for-filling-star-ratings--cms-29450)

 The second tutorial I went through was a ["How to Create a Split-Screen Slider With JavaScript"](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-create-a-split-screen-slider-with-javascript--cms-28844);
 - Here is a like to my [CodePen for this project](https://codepen.io/jbellwaite/pen/XVmNEm?editors=0110).
